This year I taught [Topics in Modern Geometry](https://www.bris.ac.uk/unit-programme-catalogue/UnitDetails.jsa?ayrCode=22%2F23&unitCode=MATHM0008) at the University of Bristol.

Previously, I was a Graduate Teaching Fellow at [Hunter College](http://math.hunter.cuny.edu/) (2016-2019), during which time I was the sole instructor of the below courses. In addition, I was a teaching assistant at [Baruch College](https://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/) (2016-2017) for the course [MTH 9831 Probability and Stochastic Processes for Finance I](https://mfe.baruch.cuny.edu/mth-9831/). In the 2019-2020 academic year I was a Math Curriculum Fellow at Baruch College, where I helped develop a new calculus course for the [Zicklin School of Business](https://zicklin.baruch.cuny.edu/).
