My research focuses on non-positive curvature in groups. I am especially interested in groups acting on cube complexes, as well as hierarchical hyperbolicity, which is a tool to study groups from a geometric point of view by exploiting patterns of hyperbolic behaviour occurring within them. This tool applies to a wide range of groups, including:

- right-angled Artin groups, right-angled Coxeter groups, and fundamental groups of special cube complexes;
- mapping class groups and Teichm√ºller space;
- 3-manifold groups containing no Nil or Sol components;
- graph products of hyperbolic groups;
- braid groups.

Recently, I have been studying random quotients of hierarchically hyperbolic groups and using cube complexes to study non-positive curvature in graph braid groups. I am also working on writing code to implement algorithms detailed in my paper on [graph braid groups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03860.pdf). For example, I have written a [programme that computes free splittings of graph braid groups](https://github.com/danberlyne/graph-braid-splitter) and, joint with [Tomasz Maciazek](https://research-information.bris.ac.uk/en/persons/tomasz-maciazek), a [programme that computes presentations of graph braid groups](https://github.com/danberlyne/graph-braid-presenter).

A copy of my research statement is available [here](/assets/pdf/Research_statement.pdf).
