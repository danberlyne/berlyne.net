Until October 2023, I was a Heilbronn Research Fellow at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/), working with [Mark Hagen](https://www.wescac.net/). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. in Mathematics at the [City University of New York](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Mathematics); my thesis advisor was [Jason Behrstock](http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/behrstock/).

My research is in geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology, with particular focus on cube complexes, braid groups, and hierarchical hyperbolicity. I recently wrote two Python programs implementing algorithms detailed in my paper on [graph braid groups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03860.pdf). The code is available on my GitHub page in the ['graph-braid-splitter'](https://github.com/danberlyne/graph-braid-splitter) and ['graph-braid-presenter'](https://github.com/danberlyne/graph-braid-presenter) repositories.

A copy of my research statement is available [here](/assets/pdf/Research_statement.pdf).

In 2022-2023, I was an organiser of the [Bristol Geometry and Topology Seminar](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/events/geometry-and-topology-seminar/), alongside [Luke Jeffreys](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~pk20963/) and [Irene Pasquinelli](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~ip13935/).

In August 2022, I organised a [conference on quotients of hierarchically hyperbolic groups](https://sites.google.com/view/hhgquotients/).
