I am currently a Heilbronn Research Fellow at the [University of Bristol](http://www.bristol.ac.uk/maths/), under the mentorship of [Mark Hagen](https://www.wescac.net/). Prior to this, I completed my Ph.D. at the [City University of New York Graduate Center](https://www.gc.cuny.edu/Page-Elements/Academics-Research-Centers-Initiatives/Doctoral-Programs/Mathematics); my thesis advisor was [Jason Behrstock](http://comet.lehman.cuny.edu/behrstock/).

My research is in geometric group theory and low-dimensional topology, with particular focus on cube complexes, braid groups, and hierarchical hyperbolicity. I am currently working on writing code to implement algorithms detailed in my paper on [graph braid groups](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2209.03860.pdf).

A copy of my research statement is available [here](/assets/pdf/Research_statement.pdf).

I am an organiser of the [Bristol Geometry and Topology Seminar](https://www.bristolmathsresearch.org/events/geometry-and-topology-seminar/), alongside [Luke Jeffreys](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~pk20963/) and [Irene Pasquinelli](https://people.maths.bris.ac.uk/~ip13935/).

I also recently organised a [conference on quotients of hierarchically hyperbolic groups](https://sites.google.com/view/hhgquotients/).
